# 🧩 Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a curated set of small-scale projects and academic experiments developed as part of my learning journey in computer science. Each subproject demonstrates a specific concept — from basic I/O and GUI design to digital logic, data structures, and low-level assembly programming.

These projects span multiple languages including **C**, **Python**, **Verilog**, **Solidity**, and **ARM Assembly**, and are organized for easy exploration and reuse.

### 🧠 if-else-parser/
- **Language**: Python (PLY - Lex/Yacc)  
- **Description**: A lexical analyzer and parser for validating the syntax of `if-else` statements written in a pseudo programming language.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Tokenization using `ply.lex`  
  - Grammar parsing using `ply.yacc`  
  - Validates nested and flat `if-else` constructs with custom rules  
  - Educational showcase of CFGs (Context-Free Grammars)

### 🔁 shift-register-verilog/
- **Language**: Verilog
- **Description**: Simulates shift-left and shift-right operations using registers and arrays.
- **Highlights**: Bitwise logic, testbenches for simulation.

### 🧪 ngo-donation-demo-solidity/
- **Language**: Solidity
- **Description**: Trial project exploring smart contract development for a decentralized NGO donation platform.
- **Highlights**:
  - Donor & NGO registration and validation
  - INR to ETH conversion logic (mocked)
  - Donation history tracking and blacklist mechanism
  - Built for learning Solidity basics like `struct`, `mapping`, and `payable`

### ⚙️ Assembly-Codes/
- **Language**: ARM Assembly
- **Description**: Collection of low-level assembly programs showcasing simple tasks and algorithms such as array operations, matrix addition, searches (linear, binary), bitwise operations, display logic for seven-segment modules etc.

#### 📄 C-DSA-Basics/
- **Language**: C
- **Description**: A collection of programs covering fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts.
- **Highlights**:
  - Arrays, linked lists (singly & doubly), binary search trees (BST), stacks, queues, and tries.
  - Demonstrates insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and merging operations.
  - Useful as reference snippets or practice material for interviews and coursework.
