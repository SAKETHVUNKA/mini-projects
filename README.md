# 🧩 Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a curated set of small-scale projects and academic experiments developed as part of my learning journey in computer science. Each subproject demonstrates a specific concept — from basic I/O and GUI design to digital logic and data structure applications.

These projects span multiple languages including **C**, **Python**, **Verilog**, and are organized for easy exploration and reuse.

## 🔍 Project Details

### 🗳️ voting-software/
- **Language**: C
- **Description**: A simple command-line voting system supporting multiple candidates and vote tallying.
- **Highlights**: Input validation, file-based storage, terminal navigation.

### 🎵 dsa-music-player/
- **Language**: C
- **Description**: Simulates a music player queue using arrays or linked lists. Demonstrates use of DSA (like queue/stack).
- **Highlights**: Dynamic queue logic, command-driven interface.

### 🌡️ converter-tkinter/
- **Language**: Python (Tkinter)
- **Description**: Desktop GUI application to convert currencies and temperatures.
- **Highlights**: Tkinter GUI design, modular functions, two-in-one utility.

### 🔁 shift-register-verilog/
- **Language**: Verilog
- **Description**: Simulates shift-left and shift-right operations using registers and arrays.
- **Highlights**: Bitwise logic, testbenches for simulation.
