# 🧩 Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a curated set of small-scale projects and academic experiments developed as part of my learning journey in computer science. Each subproject demonstrates a specific concept — from basic I/O and GUI design to digital logic and data structure applications.

These projects span multiple languages including **C**, **Python**, **Verilog**, **Solidity**, and are organized for easy exploration and reuse.

## 🔍 Project Details

### 🗳️ voting-software/
- **Language**: C
- **Description**: A simple command-line voting system supporting multiple candidates and vote tallying.
- **Highlights**: Input validation, file-based storage, terminal navigation.

### 🎵 dsa-music-player/
- **Language**: C
- **Description**: Simulates a music player queue using arrays or linked lists. Demonstrates use of DSA (like queue/stack).
- **Highlights**: Dynamic queue logic, command-driven interface.

### 🌡️ converter-tkinter/
- **Language**: Python (Tkinter)
- **Description**: Desktop GUI application to convert currencies and temperatures.
- **Highlights**: Tkinter GUI design, modular functions, two-in-one utility.

### 🧠 if-else-parser/
- **Language**: Python (PLY - Lex/Yacc)  
- **Description**: A lexical analyzer and parser for validating the syntax of `if-else` statements written in a pseudo programming language.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Tokenization using `ply.lex`  
  - Grammar parsing using `ply.yacc`  
  - Validates nested and flat `if-else` constructs with custom rules  
  - Educational showcase of CFGs (Context-Free Grammars)

### 🔁 shift-register-verilog/
- **Language**: Verilog
- **Description**: Simulates shift-left and shift-right operations using registers and arrays.
- **Highlights**: Bitwise logic, testbenches for simulation.

### 🧪 ngo-donation-demo-solidity/
- **Language**: Solidity
- **Description**: Trial project exploring smart contract development for a decentralized NGO donation platform.
- **Highlights**:
  - Donor & NGO registration and validation
  - INR to ETH conversion logic (mocked)
  - Donation history tracking and blacklist mechanism
  - Built for learning Solidity basics like `struct`, `mapping`, and `payable`
